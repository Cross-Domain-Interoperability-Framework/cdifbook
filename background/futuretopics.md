# Future work

Topics of interest for future work to enhance the framework:
1. Provenance (the description of provenance and processing)
2. Context (the description of ‘context’ in the form of dependencies between fields within the data and a description of the research setting)
3. Perspectives on artificial initelligence (exploring the impacts of AI and the role that metadata can play)
4. Packaging (the creation of archival and dissemination packages)
5. Additional Data Formats (data formats not fully supported in the initial release, such as [NetCDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF), [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), and [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) ).
