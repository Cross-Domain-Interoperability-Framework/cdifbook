The CDIF book https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook is the major integrated source of documentation for CDIF.  The book is built using Jupyter-book tools on github.  The book is built from a set of markdown files in folders for each section. Book configuration is defined in the _config.yml file. The _toc.yml file organizes the markdown files from the various folders into the correct chapter layout.
