# Metadata Recommendations

CDIF recommendations to support basic resource discovery on the World Web fall into three groups:
1. A [Content model](./contentmodel.md) that specifies the information expected to be included in any metadata record, with required, recommended and optional content items. 
2. A [JSON-LD serialization](./schemaorgimplementation.md) for that content using the Schema.org vocabulary to define the fields in a metadata record, and an [implementation using the DCAT rdf vocabulary](./dcat.md)
3. [Workflows to publish CDIF metadata](./publication.md) so that is can be found and indexed by search providers using standard web technology
