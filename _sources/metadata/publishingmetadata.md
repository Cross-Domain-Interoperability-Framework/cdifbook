# Publishing metadata

The use of standardised metadata to describe resources is one facet of discoverability, but mechanisms to make these metadata descriptions discoverable by search applications or other machine agents is also necessary. Search applications harvest metadata to index and present in search results. In other cases a machine agent might have an identifier for a resource on the Web and want to get its metadata to learn about the content and capabilities of the resource.

## Signposting
Signposting is an approach to discovering the content and capabilities of resources accessed by resolving URIs on the Web. Like the FAIR Digital Object framework, it starts with an identifier that can be resolved, and uses typed Web links ([IETF RFC8288](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8288)) and [IANA registered relationship](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml) types to enable an agent to discover what is identified and navigate to metadata with more information. These signposting links can implement the linking requirements of the [Fair Digital Object Framework](https://www.slideshare.net/hvdsomp/fair-signposting-a-kiss-approach-to-a-burning-issue). The CDIF metadata requirements outlined below include recommended or optional properties necessary to create a FDO PID Kernel information record (FDOFIdentificationRecord in Figure 1, below) as recommended by the Research Data Alliance (RDA)([Weigel et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00031) ). Signposting can be used to implement FDOF requirements, and in the following implementation discussion we outline how Signposting is compatible with CDIF. The mapping from the PID Kernel information record to the CDIF metadata schema.org recommended implementation is shown in [PID kernel mapping](). Mapping from Signposting link relation types to CDIF metadata elements is shown in [Signposting link mapping]().
