# Publishing metadata

The use of standardised metadata to describe resources is one facet of discoverability, but mechanisms to make these metadata descriptions discoverable by search applications or other machine agents is also necessary. Search applications harvest metadata to index and present in search results. In other cases a machine agent might have an identifier for a resource on the Web and want to get its metadata to learn about the content and capabilities of the resource.
