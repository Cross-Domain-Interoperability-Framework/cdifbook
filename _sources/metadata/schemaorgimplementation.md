# Serialization of CDIF metadata 

JSON-LD has been chosen as the recommended serialization format for CDIF metadata following our principle to use existing mainstream technology. The JSON format is widely used for data serialization and popular with developers. JSON-LD adds additional syntax for the representation of linked data, compatible with existing JSON implementations so that integration with existing applications is relatively frictionless. Many metadata providers are using the schema.org[^32] vocabularies with JSON-LD serialization for metadata publication and interchange. Use of this format provides a low barrier to entry for data providers.

The JSON syntax is defined by the [ECMA JSON specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/), and JSON-LD is specified in the [JSON-LD 1.1 recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This serialization is designed for linked data applications that will translate the JSON into a set of {subject, predicate, object} triples that can be loaded into an RDF database for processing. The JSON-LD context binds JSON keys to URIs for more precise semantics, and the use of URIs to identify entities and property values in the metadata will maximize the linkage with resources on the wider web to build an ever-expanding global knowledge graph.

A metadata record has two parts; one part is about the metadata record itself, the other part is the content about the resource that the metadata documents. The part about the record specifies the identifier for the metadata record, agents with responsibility for the record, when it was last updated, what specification or profiles the metadata serialization conforms to, and other optional properties of the metadata that are deemed useful. The metadata about the resource has properties about the resource like title, description, responsible parties, spatial or temporal extent (as outlined in the [Metadata Content Requirements](#mdcontent) section).

Schema.org includes several properties that can be used to embed information about the metadata record in the resource metadata: [**sdDatePublished**](https://schema.org/sdDatePublished), [**sdLicense**](https://schema.org/sdLicense), [**sdPublisher**](https://schema.org/sdPublisher), but lacks a way to provide an identifier for the metadata record distinct from the resource it describes, to specify other agents responsible for the metadata except the publisher, or to assert specification or profile conformance for the metadata record itself.

To include this information in CDIF metadata, the recommendation is the following pattern, using schema:subjectOf property to provide an @id for the metadata record, and assert properties useful for metadata management in a distributed, federated catalog system.   The pattern is like this:

```
{   "@context": [
        "https://schema.org",
        {"dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
         "ex":"https://example.com/99152/"
        }
    ],
    "@id": "ex:URIforDescribedResource",
    "@type": "appropriate schema.org type",
    "name": "unique title for the resource",
    "description": "Description of the resource",
    "subjectOf": {
        "@id": "ex:URIforTheMetadata",
        "@type": "DigitalDocument",
        "dateModified": "2017-05-23",
        "description":"this metadata document",
        "encoding": {
            "@type": "MediaObject",
    	    "dcterms:conformsTo": {"@id":"ex:cdif-metadataSpec"}
          },
        "about":{"@id":"ex:URIforDescribedResource"}
	}
```
 ..... other metadata content omitted
```          
   }
```

Including the schema:description with the string "this metadata document" will allow disambiguating different usages of the subjectOf property.  Including the 'about' property with the back link to ex:URIforDescribedResource is useful but could be calculated with inverse of the subjectOf property.  The ex namespace in the example above is only included so the example is valid; actual metadata would likely have its own namespace for resource and metadata URIs. The distinct identifier for the metadata record allows statements to be made about the metadata separately from statements about the resource it describes. Note that the @type for the metadata node (root node) is 'DigitalDocument'. This is a schema.org type that corresponds broadly to the concept of DigitalObject as used by the Fair Digital Object (FDO) community ([Bonino et al., 2022](https://fairdigitalobjectframework.org/) ), recognizing that the metadata record is a digital object.


JSON keys prefixed with '@' are keywords defined in the [JSON-LD specification]( https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#keywords) (see table below)

 | Keyword  |   Description|
 |----------- |-------------|
 | \@context |  The value of the context is an object that specifies set of rules for interpreting the JSON-LD document. The rules can be specified inline in, or via a URI that identifies a context object containing a set of rules. |
|  \@id    |    A string that identifies the subject of the assertions in the JSON object that contains the \@id key.|
|  \@type   |   An identifier for the definition of the structure of the JSON object that contains the \@type key. The type determines what keys or values should be expected in the JSON object that contains the key. Values are types defined in the schema.org vocabulary. In the CDIF framework (and for compatibility with FDOF FDOF digitalObjectType), the schema:additionalType property should be used (see implementation table below) |
 

# Implementation of metadata content items

The following table maps the metadata content items described in the [Metadata Content Requirements](#mdcontent) section to the schema.org JSON-LD keys to use in metadata serialization. Some example metadata documents follow. The \'Obl.\' column specifies the cardinality obligation for the property; \'1\' means one value required; 1..\* means at least one value is required; 0..\* means the property is optional and more that one value can be provided. Properties with path from "subjectOf" describe the metadata.


| **CDIF content item**       | **Obl.** | **Schema.org implementation**   | **Scope note**                              |
|----------- |-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Metadata identifier         | 1        | "subjectOf"/"@id":{URI}    | The URI for the metadata record should be the \@id value for the 'subjectOf' element in the JSON instance document tree   |
| Resource identifier         | 1        | "@id":{URI}    | The URI for the resource should be the @id value for the root of the JSON instance document tree   | 
| Title      | 1        | "name":{string}     | A set of words that should uniquely identify the described resource for human use, in the scope of the metadata catalog containing this metadata record.     |
| Distribution        | 1        | "url":{URL}       | If metadata is about a single digital object      |
|             |          | "distribution": <br>   { \"@type\": \"DataDownload\", <br>    \"contentURL\": {URL },\...   }   | If the metadata is about an abstract, non-digital, or physical resource that has multiple distributions, with different URL, encodingFormat, conformsTo properties. Each distribution is considered a distinct digital object. |

There might be multiple links to documents specifying related security, privacy, usage, sharing, etc\... concerns.    |
| Metadata profile identifier | 1        | "subjectOf"/"encoding"/"dcterms:conformsTo": {identifier} <br> or <br>  "schemaVersion":{identifier}          | Use Dublin Core terms property. The value for Base CDIF metadata is 'CDIF_basic_1.0'. Different profiles extending this must define unique identifier strings to use here. *QUESTION--Which to use dct:conformsTo or schema:schema:Version?*  |
| Metadata date               | 0..1     | "subjectOf"/"dateModified":{Date or DateTime}     | Use ISO8601 format. The most recent update date for the metadata content. Harvesters use this to determine if they have already harvested and processed this record.   |
| Metadata contact            | 0..1     | / "subjectOf"/"maintainer":{Person or Organization}   | Should include a name and contact point (institutional e-mail is best) for the agent responsible for metadata content. This is the contact point to report problems with metadata content. Person and Organization are Agent objects with various properties.   |
| Resource type               | 1        | "@type":{schema.org type}      | If the [Schema.org resource types](https://schema.org/docs/full.html) are specific enough to scope the metadata record, use those.   |

| GeographicExtent (named place)           | 0..\*     |  \"spatialCoverage\": { \"@type\": \"Place\",<br>\"name\": {string} or {schema:DefinedTerm} }  | To specify location with place names; if the names are from a gazeteer, use the schema:DefinedTerm to provide a name, identifier, and inDefinedTermSet to fully document the concept. |
| GeographicExtent (bounding box)  | 0..1 | \"spatialCoverage\": { <br>\"@type\": \"Place\",<br> \"geo\": {  \"@type\": \"GeoShape\", <br> \"box\": \"39.3280    120.1633  40.445    123.7878\"   } } }  | For bounding box specification of the spatial extent of resource content. See [ESIP SOSO for details](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#bounding-boxes). Recommend including only one bounding box; behavior of harvesting clients when multiple geometries are specified is unpredictable.   |

Variable must have a name and description, should have a propertyID with URI for the represented concept. The URI in the propertyID provides the semantic linkage for meaning of the variable.     |

These properties expect WebPage and Action as their domain, so the [schema.org validator](https://validator.schema.org/) will throw a warning (not an error). Related resource links are useful for evaluation and use of data, but because of the wide variety of relationship possibilities, difficult to use in general search scenarios. Use a soft-type implementation, with a link relationship type using a schema:DefinedTerm, and a resolvable identifier for the relationship target.   |

If the resource is a single DigitalObject, use the first partter, if there are multiple distributions, the checksum is a property of each distribution/DataDownload. |

# Implementation patterns

-   DefinedTerm. {label, schemename, conceptURI, schemeURI}. This is a pattern used for property values that are concepts defined in a controlled vocabulary, ontology, or similar semantic artefact. Values have a label, which is a string that will be meaningful to a human user, a 'schemename', which is a label that similarly identifies the source semantic resource in which the concept is defined, the conceptURI is a globally unique,resolvable identifier forthe concept value; schemeURI is a globally unique identifier for teh semantic resource in which the concept is defined.

-   Identifier. {identifier scheme, identifier string, resolvable identifier string}. This pattern is for identifiers that are useful to scope in the context of a scheme. The identifier scheme is associated with some authority (e.g. IBSN) that manages unique identifiers within their scope. If the identifier can be associated with a resolver to create a resolvable identifier string, typically an HTTP URL with a resolver host name (e.g https://n2t.net/) to which the identifier is suffixed to obtain a representation of the thing identified.

-   AgentObject. {name, agenttype, identifier, contactpoint, if the agen is a Person, include affiliation}. This pattern is for specifying an Agent in the prove sense: An agent is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent\'s activity. Agents can be persons, organizations, or software-defined actors. Agents have a name for human recognition, a type, an identifier, contactPoint and affiliation. Machine agent contact points should be the accessible human who operations the environment running the machine agent.

-   DistributionObject {contentURL, encodingFormat, conformsTo, distributionAgent }. A pattern for specifying information necessary or useful for implementing machine access to a DigitalObject that is or represents a resource of interest. Includes a URL for the web location at which the DigitalObject can be accesses, the specifications or profiles to which the serialization and content of the object conform, and the Agent responsible for the distribution platform. This agent is the contact point if there are problems accessing the distributed digitalObject.
