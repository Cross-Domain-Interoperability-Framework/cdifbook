# Statistical Classification

*tbd-- need definition of statistical classification, some detail about added xkos properties, perhaps some examples.*

Documentation of formal statistical classifications includes additional information. CDIF recommends using the style used at [Eurostat](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/book-page/modeling-eurostats-statistical-classifications-showvoc) and [FAO](https://www.fao.org/statistics/caliper/resources/data-modeling/en). These descriptions include additonal properties, and can include tables documenting mapping between versions of classifications. This information is represented using XKOS, see the [XKOS specification](https://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/xkos.html) and [user guide](https://linked-statistics.github.io/xkos/xkos-best-practices.html).
