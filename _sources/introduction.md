# Introduction

Many important research questions demand a multi-disciplinary approach in which data andresources are used across domain and infrastructure boundaries. In such scenarios, domain-specificcommunity standards fall short of the requirements for FAIR exchange of the critical metadata and otherinformation needed. The Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) is designed to support FAIR implementation for these projects by establishing a ‘lingua franca’ for this information, based on existing standards and technology to support interoperability, in both human- and machine-actionable fashion. CDIF is a set of implementation recommendations, based on profiles of common, domain-neutral metadata standards which are aligned to work together to support core functions required by FAIR.  

The idea for CDIF first emerged from workshops and discussions at conferences prior to the WorldFAIR project, beginning in 2018. The WorldFAIR project provided an opportunity to advance that vision, through aset of 11 case studies across many domains, allowing the needs and practices around FAIR within such domains to be summarised in the form of FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs). Based on the FIPs and focused meetings, the requirements for CDIF were established. A group of 30 invited experts from different FAIR initiatives and standards bodies made up a Working Group and an Advisory Group to synthesise the findings from WorldFAIR and to produce the current CDIF draft. 

The framework is based on a set of five core profiles that address the most important functions for
cross-domain FAIR implementation.
1. Discovery (patterns for metadata content, serialization and publication)
2. Data access (documentation of access conditions and permitted use)
3. Controlled vocabularies (practices for the publication of controlled vocabularies and semantic
artefacts)
4. Data integration (documentation of the structural and semantic aspects of data to make it
integration-ready)
5. Universals (description of ‘universal’ elements -- time, geography, and units of measurement).

Each of these profiles is supported by specific recommendations, including the set of metadata fields in
specific standards to use, and the method of implementation to be employed for machine-level
interoperability.
