# Metadata Recommendations

CDIF recommendations to support basic resource discovery on the World Web fall into three groups:
1. A Content model that specifies the information expected to be included in any metadata record, with required, recommended and optional content items.
2. A JSON-LD serialization for that content using the Schema.org vocabulary to define the fields in a metadata record.
3. Workflows to publish CDIF metadata so that is can be found and indexed by search providers using standard web technology
