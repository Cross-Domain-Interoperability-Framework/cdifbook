# Metadata for making data ‘integration ready’: DDI-CDI classes and properties 

This appendix lists the classes discussed in the text above, and indicates which properties must or may 
be used when these classes are instantiated. 
It should be noted that while the Data Set and Data Structure classes appear in the DDI-CDI model, and 
are used in the diagrams above, these are never directly instantiated. Instead, their sub-classes will be 
used: Wide Data Set/Wide Data Structure, Long Data Set/Long Data Structure, and Dimensional Data 
Set/Dimensional Data Structure. For this reason, Data Set and Data Structure are not listed here. 
The identifiers of each metadata declaration (or instance) are assumed to be the URI used in the JSON
LD. If other identifiers are to be associated with the instances, all of the classes listed can also use an 
identifier property as per the DDI-CDI specification. This is not required, however, as it is assumed that 
consumers of CDIF metadata will typically not be interested in non-public identifiers of this type. 
Properties and associations are listed as “Required” or “Optional”, followed by “Multiple” if more than 
one is allowed. Language-specific strings are allowed to be multiple, specific to language-locale pairs, 
using language maps as described in Example 71 of the JSON-LD specification12. 
All metadata instances will have @type referencing the DDI-CDI class, given in the “Type” field. Some 
instances will declare multiple types where appropriate.  The classes are grouped by type, largely in the 
order they are mentioned in the steps above. 
Note that associations and properties are distinct in DDI-CDI, because it is based on a UML formalisation 
where such a distinction is important (associations never link to literal values). They are listed separately 
here, for ease of reference to the DDI-CDI documentation.

contain values from the set of logical variables held in the data, and must have a representation which 
supports the full range of possible values from them.

? None. 
Associations: 
? recommendedDataType (Required) - provides a link either to a skos:ConceptScheme (for 
enumerated values) or an XSD data type (see list in the text above). This describes the datatype 
of the values permitted as valid for populating the fields described by the variable. 
Sentinel Value Domain 
Sentinel values are those which indicate some process or system status or value which is not directly 
meaningful in terms of the variable definition of the field they populate. A typical example is flags for 
missing values. 
Type: cdi:SentinelValueDomain 
Properties: 
? None. 
Associations: 
? recommendedDataType (Required) - provides a link either to a skos:ConceptScheme (for

property. 
Unity Type 
A Unit Type is the object or phenomenon serving as the subject of a data record, identified at a general 
level. If the values in a data set are “Age,” “Sex”, and “Occupation” the Unit Type would be “person”. If 
the values are a measure of salinity and depth, the Unit Type might be “sea water”. The value of an 
instance of cdi:UnitType is the general term for the unifying subject of a data record (an instance of 
cdi:LogicalRecord).

An instance of cdi:Universe qualifies a Unit Type, to provide a more-specific description of the subject of 
the data, but excluding time and geography. If the Unit Type is “person,” the Universe might be “adults”. 
If the Unit Type is “sea water,” the Universe might be “sea water in temperate oceans”. 
Type: cdi:Universe

? name (Required) – a string value holding the name of the variable. May be provided in multiple, 
language-specific versions.

? name (Required) – a string value holding the name of the variable. May be provided in multiple, 
language-specific versions.

? uses (Optional, 2 Maximum) – a reference to the instance of cdi:Universe and/or cdi:UnitType 
which the Universe qualifies.  
Identifier Component 
The instance of cdi:IdentifierComponent is a reference to a variable which provides a unique identifier 
for the case being observed in the Logical Record. It is typically an assigned or official identifier for the 
unit, according to an external scheme (e.g., a taxpayer ID for a person, a sample identifier, etc.). The 
Identifier Component is a role attached to the variable to describe its function within the data structure - it is usually part of (and may be the entire) key for the record. 
Type: cdi:IdentifierComponent 
Properties: 
? None. 
Associations: 
? isDefinedBy (Required) – A reference to an instance of cdi:InstanceVariable (or, if present, 
cdi:RepresentedVariable) which defines the Identifier Component variable. 
Measure Component 
The instance of cdi:MeasureComponent indicates that the referenced variable contains a measurement 
or observation value, or a derived value, within the Logical Record. Bote that cdi:MeasureComponent 
might be a simple value (string, number, term), or an object (e.g. an array of spectral values). 
For this profile, we are restricting discussion to simple values. 
Type: cdi:MeasureComponent

describes the values in the Measure Components or otherwise provides information which is not itself a 
measure/observation or derived value.

Associations: 
? isDefinedBy (Required) – A reference to an instance of cdi:InstanceVariable (or, if present, 
cdi:RepresentedVariable) which defines the Attribute Component variable. 
Dimension Component 
The instances of cdi:DimensionComponent are references to the variables which are the components of 
a compound identifier, in which each variable is a single field - an axis - in a coordinate system 
addressing a location in a matrix. These variables are often categorical, but also commonly include time. 
Unlike other Components, they may be ordered using instances of  cdi:ComponentPosition. 
Type: cdi:DimensionComponent

ordered. Assigns the value to it as a position within the Primary Key. 
Primary Key 
The instance of Primary Key defines the set of Components which, taken together, provide the 
identifying values for a single logical record within a data structure. The values of the Primary Key are 
used to reference the non-Primary Key fields within the Logical Record, by additionally  specifying the 
Component/Instance Variable wanted. Such fields include the Measure Components and non-identifying 
Attribute Components.

of several logical variables combined into a single field within a Long Data Structure. This Component is 
part of a presentational structure, as opposed to a logical one.

containing header information. Only used if hasHeader has a value of “true”. 
? isDelimited (Optional) - A boolean value indicated as “true” or “false” (case sensitive) which says

“true” then isFixedWidth must have a value of “false” if provided. 
? isFixedWidth (Optional) - A boolean value indicated as “true” or “false” (case sensitive) which 
says whether the file has fixed-width fields. If “true” then isDelimited must have a value of 
“false” if provided. The starting and ending positions of each field are provided by the instances 
of cdi:ValueMapping associated with each variable in the record, in relation to the arrayBase 
property.
